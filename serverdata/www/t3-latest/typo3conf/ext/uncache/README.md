## TYPO3 extension Uncache: Caches? What do you mean, caches...?

### What is it?

A cache preventer.

### What does it do?

Prevents caching.

### How does it work?

You know what a cache does? This doesn't do that.

### Where does it work?

On TYPO3 6.0 only. With my sincere apologies.

### Which cache types does it prevent?

Logic flowchart:

1. Is it a cache?
2. Then it is prevented!

### Can it still allow some caches to work?

See the flowchart above.

### How to use

Install; then forget that you ever had a _clear all caches_ button which was __always__ eight keystrokes and two mouse clicks away.

## Have fun, enjoy!
